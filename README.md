# Personal Financial Dashboard in Power BI

This is a personal project created in Power BI with the goal of organizing and visualizing my financial data more effectively. It directly connects to Google Sheets, pulling information about **income, expenses, and investments**, and presents this data in intuitive dashboards with interactive charts and filters.

> ⚠️ This repository is in its first version and **is still under development**. It is private for now until it is more polished for public sharing.

## 📊 Key Features

- **Overview Dashboard**: An overview with key indicators:
  - Total revenue
  - Expenses

  - Money saved
  - Investments made
- **Income Page**: Detailed analysis of earnings by category, source, and period.
- **Expenses Page**: View of expenses with filters by type, amount, and date.
- **Investments Page**: Tracking and monitoring of investments made.

## 💡 Objective

The project arose from the need to have a "personal financial tracker" that helps me better monitor my financial life, understand where my money is going, what is being invested, and what can be improved.
